                strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated
                samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a
                contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding
                path that enables precise localization. We show that such a
                network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and
                outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional
                network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal
                structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network
                trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast
                and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these
                categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast.
                Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a
                recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the
                trained networks are available at
